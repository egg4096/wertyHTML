# wertyHTML
### Description:
HTML with less typing.
###### *this thing's in development, but I'm too lazy to develop.*

### Installation:
On GitHub, press `Code -> Download ZIP`. After downloading the ZIP, extract it.

### Running:
Write some wertyHTML into the input.txt file, and after opening the command prompt and locating the wertyHTML-main folder using `cd`, write `python translate.py`, which should convert the wertyHTML in input.txt to HTML in output.html.

### Bonus for Linux users:
After locating the wertyHTML-main folder, type `chmod +x see.sh` and you'll be able to write `./see.sh`, which should quickly convert and open your wertyHTML.

### Writing in wertyHTML:
```
# here's a simple example, the <!doctype> and <html> tags aren't written in wertyHTML:

head [
    p [you can write your brackets Java style]
    table border="1" [
        tr [
            td colspan="2" [lol]
            td []
            td []
            td []
        ] tr [
            td []
            td []
            td []
            td []
            td []
        ]
    ]
]

body
[
    h2 [or in really any other way] ]
```
