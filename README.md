# wertyHTML
### Description:
HTML with less typing.

### Installation:
On GitHub, press `Code -> Download ZIP`. After downloading the ZIP, extract it.

### Usage:
Write some wertyHTML into the input.txt file, and after opening the command prompt and locating the wertyHTML-main folder using `cd`, write `python translate.py`, which should convert the wertyHTML in input.txt to HTML in output.html.

After locating the wertyHTML-main folder, type `chmod +x see.sh` and you'll be able to write `./see.sh`, which should quickly convert and open your wertyHTML.
